Question:
What is our current event streaming platform, and which ADR superseded the previous one? (ids + dates)

Answer:
- Current event streaming platform: ADR-0005 Switch to Cloud Pub/Sub (Google Pub/Sub), dated 2023-06-05.
- ADR that superseded the previous one: ADR-0005 supersedes ADR-0001 (Use Kafka for Event Streaming), dated 2022-09-14.

Question:
What is our current event streaming platform, and which ADR superseded the previous one? (ids + dates)

Answer:
- Current event streaming platform: Google Cloud Pub/Sub, as defined in ADR-0005: Switch to Cloud Pub/Sub (Date: 2023-06-05). This ADR supersedes ADR-0001: Use Kafka for Event Streaming (Date: 2022-09-14).

Question:
Given we switched to Pub/Sub, what ADR(s) still govern event contract/schema governance, and what tooling do we use?

Answer:
- Governing ADR: ADR-0008 — Introduce Schema Registry for Event Contracts (governs event contract/schema governance).
- Tooling used: Confluent Schema Registry with Avro schemas; compatibility checks enforced in CI/CD pipelines.

Question:
Given we switched to Pub/Sub, what ADR(s) still govern event contract/schema governance, and what tooling do we use?

Answer:
- ADRs in effect
  - ADR-0005 governs event streaming and the switch to Google Pub/Sub. 
  - ADR-0008 governs event contract/schema governance (schema registry, compatibility, etc.). 

- Tooling used
  - Confluent Schema Registry with Avro for event schemas. 
  - Compatibility checks enforced via CI/CD pipelines (as part of ADR-0008). 
  - Registry-driven governance implies an extra schema registration step in the developer workflow. 

In short: Pub/Sub is governed by ADR-0005; event contract/schema governance is still governed by ADR-0008, with Confluent Schema Registry (Avro) and CI/CD checks as the primary tooling. fileciteturn0file1turn0file7

Question:
Timeline of messaging platform decisions?

Answer:
Here’s a concise timeline of the messaging/event-streaming platform decisions:

- 2022-09-14 — ADR-0001: Use Kafka for Event Streaming
  - Status: Accepted
  - Decision: Adopt Apache Kafka to decouple microservices (e.g., Order, Customer, Inventory)
  - Outcome: Kafka chosen as the messaging backbone

- 2023-06-05 — ADR-0005: Switch to Cloud Pub/Sub
  - Status: Accepted
  - Decision: Switch from Apache Kafka to Google Pub/Sub
  - Outcome: Reduces operational overhead; Pub/Sub is managed; migration needed from existing Kafka topics
  - Supersedes: ADR-0001 (Kafka ADR)

- 2024-01-17 — ADR-0010: Establish ADR Lineage (Supersedes/Amends) Metadata
  - Status: Accepted
  - Relation: Formalizes lineage and governance around ADRs, noting ADR-0005 governs the event-streaming platform
  - Note: Not a new messaging platform choice, but important for traceability

Current state: The messaging platform decision is ADR-0005, i.e., Google Pub/Sub.

Question:
Timeline of messaging platform decisions?

Answer:
Here is the timeline of the messaging platform (event-streaming) decisions, based on the ADRs in your files:

- 2022-09-14: ADR-0001 — Use Kafka for Event Streaming. Status: Accepted. This was the initial choice before later changes. It was superseded by ADR-0005. 

- 2023-06-05: ADR-0005 — Switch to Cloud Pub/Sub (Google Pub/Sub) as the event streaming platform. Status: Accepted. This ADR supersedes ADR-0001. 

- 2023-10-20: ADR-0008 — Introduce Schema Registry for Event Contracts (Confluent Schema Registry with Avro). Status: Accepted. This establishes schema governance for events. 

- 2024-01-10: ADR-0009 — Define Service Ownership and Dependency Map (relevant to governance of messaging and services). Status: Accepted. 

- 2024-01-17: ADR-0010 — Establish ADR Lineage (Supersedes/Amends) Metadata. Status: Accepted. Provides lineage for ADRs and related decisions. 

Notes:
- ADR-0005 explicitly supersedes ADR-0001, marking the shift from Kafka to Google Pub/Sub. 
- Related ADRs (e.g., ADR-0003 on service-to-service authentication and ADR-0004 on API Gateway) provide broader platform context but aren’t the core messaging-backbone decisions above. 

If you’d like, I can format this as a compact table or extract only the items strictly about the messaging backbone.
